Create a RESTful service in PHP that would allow a game to post a user's score for ranking on a leaderboard. Assume the player of the game will be coming from a Facebook application so you will be passed a Facebook "signed_request" variable with the information about the user along with the user's score. Decode the signed_request to get the user's unique id. Design a schema for storing the data for the player and the score information.

Build a function to populate the database tables with 1,000,000 rows of sample data.

Build a report that efficiently answers the following questions:

       • How many total players are there?
       • How many people played the game today?
       • List the top 10 players (by score)
       • List the top 10 players who improved their score over the course of the week (the difference between the high score they posted last week and their high score this week).  You can assume the week ends Sunday at midnight.

You can use the following Facebook application data and signed request for a user:

appId:  126767144061773
secret: 21db65a65e204cca7b5afcbad91fea59

signed_request: cjv1NZlSRCthYq9rAyWEidD7QE98p0PKZvVwpQ7gPwg.eyJhbGdvcml0aG0iOiJITUFDLVNIQTI1NiIsImV4cGlyZXMiOjEzMjI4NTYwMDAsImlzc3VlZF9hdCI6MTMyMjg1MDc1NCwib2F1dGhfdG9rZW4iOiJBQUFCelMwYVhTMDBCQUlob0I1bmhrYnZJU0xLSGpNb3ZIN2ZTTmMzWkFxbnVNT2NvYmpJUHoxNGFmWXV1dzBkbkZzeVpBV2JHU2MycXZBakdjRzZUQ1RWZzBLOUVGUWJ5WkJwNTU0ZXE5M2FTWkFXZXpVeEYiLCJ1c2VyIjp7ImNvdW50cnkiOiJ1cyIsImxvY2FsZSI6ImVuX1VTIiwiYWdlIjp7Im1pbiI6MjF9fSwidXNlcl9pZCI6IjEwMDAwMzI5MTY2MTkwOSJ9
